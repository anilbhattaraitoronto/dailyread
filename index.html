                <p class="first-para">Bruno Latour is perhaps one of the most famous social scientists living today.
                    For over five decades, he has been arguing that social scientists have not paid adequate attention
                    to the active non-human constituents of the material world. This neglect has limited the efficacy
                    of their work in illuminating the world humans have occupied. For long, they have been operating
                    under an illusion that, somehow, the human world can be explained without taking into account the
                    other active material constituents. <a href="/pages/book_reviews/2018/november/latour_2018_down_to_earth.html">

            <h2 class="title">About <em>Nepal Reviewed</em></h2>
            <p>Recently, there has been a phenomenal growth of academic writings on Nepal. This growth has occurred in
                all academic fields. In <em>Nepal Reviewed</em>, we
                strive to present some of those writings in publicly accessible forms.</p>
            <p> We believe that, while scholars have a lot to contribute to enriching our understanding
                about changing realities of Nepal, that understanding can be widely distributed if what scholars write
                becomes more accessible to the public. </p>
