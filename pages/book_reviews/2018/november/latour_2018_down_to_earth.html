        <p class="first-para">Bruno Latour is perhaps one of the most famous social scientists living today.
            For over five decades, he has been arguing that social scientists have not paid adequate attention
            to the active non-human constituents of the material world. This neglect has limited the efficacy
            of their work in illuminating the world humans have occupied. For long, they have been operating
            under an illusion that, somehow, the human world can be explained without taking into account the
            other active material constituents.</p>
        <p>This attitude is no longer tenable in the face of the emerging reality of changing climate. If
            social scientists are to be effective in making sense of the world, then they can no longer escape
            into the all-too-human world. </p>
