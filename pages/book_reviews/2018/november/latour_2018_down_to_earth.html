        <p class="first-para">Bruno Latour is perhaps one of the most famous social scientists living today.
            For over five decades, he has been arguing that social scientists have not paid adequate attention
            to the active non-human constituents of the material world. According to him, this neglect has limited the
            efficacy
            of social science in illuminating the world humans have occupied. For long, they have been carrying out
            their research, writing and teaching
            under an illusion that, somehow, the human world can be explained without taking into serious account the
            other active material constituents. At best, the non-human world is a backdrop on which human drama played
            out. </p>
        <p>This attitude is no longer tenable given the hard-to-ignore problems that we face: the changing climate,
            disappearing biodiversity, pollution, increase in catastrophic events. <strong><em>Down to Earth</em>
            </strong> extends the
            Latourian argument in charting out a path for understanding and acting in the world characterized by
            changing climate. If
            social scientists are to be effective in making sense of the world, and therefore, in helping humans act
            sensibly in addressing the problems, then they can no longer escape
            into the all-too-human world.</p>
        <h3>The New Climate Context</h3>
        <p>Latour begins with a broad definition of climate as <em> "the relations between human beings and the
                material condition of their lives." </em> (p.1). We have come to an inescapable conclusion that these
            relations have had profound implications for the very existence of humans. The latest in the series of
            realizations is the one about the very unmaking of relatively stable climate systems that emerged about ten
            thousand years ago. Humans have come to understand the unmaking not only at the level of everyday
            experiences, but through scientific understanding involving a network of humans, institutions, and
            instruments.
        </p>
        <p>The new climate regime has given rise to a problem of "facing a universal lack of shareable space and
            inhabitable land." (p.9) This sounds a bit more apocalyptic than is warranted by our current understanding,
            though. His proposal, however broad, is worthy of consideration: "discovering in common what land is
            inhabitable and with whom to share it." (p.9)</p>
        <p>This task calls for remaking of the very fabric of politics. The old political thinking is too limiting.
            Here, Latour goes beyond academia and calls for radical overhaul of our political positionings themselves.
            The task still is social scientific and philosophical, however.</p>
        <p>His particular focus is left politics. He has both suggestions as well as warnings. It comes out clearly
            that he has pinned his hope on left politics, but he is also clear that the conventional left politics have
            no capacity to deal with what is emerging. </p>
        <h3>Left Politics</h3>
        <p>As with the social scientists, he argues that left politics cannot go on pretending that the non-human
            material world is a mere backdrop for human action. The rest of the material world is not mere inert
            substance malleable infinitely through human actions. On the contrary, they are vibrant, active matters.
            Even the seemingly non-living world is highly active with its own history, properties, and capacities
            endowed over time. Humans have come to more and more precise understanding about this nature of the
            non-human world. Experiences have also shown the active nature of this world. But, somehow, in both social
            theory and left politics, it was obscured.</p>
        <p>Still, we do not know what exactly are we to do as humans if we take into consideration the fact that the
            non-human world is also an active world. Maybe, Latour's objective in this book is to make an opening that
            can lead to fresh ways of thinking. This book is definitely of interest to a wide range of actors: social
            scientists, activists, scientists, and general public.</p>
